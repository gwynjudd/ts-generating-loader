Simple example demonstrating generating Typescript with a custom loader.

`npm install`
`npm run build`

Note the commented out section in `my-own-loader.js`.  Uncomment it to write the `.ts` files processed by `my-own-loader` to disk.  Doing so is probably necessary in a development environment to appease the IDE.
